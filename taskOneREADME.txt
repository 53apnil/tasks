taskOne.c code is trying to find out those elements in array for which at list two distinct larger elements are there.

Firstly it uses the tim sort to sort the array which takes time O(nlogn-d).
d are the number of elements on whih insertion sort is applied at each recussive call of mergesort.

Then in main function actual logic has been clarify by using the comments.

To run the code compile it and run a.out file and provide the input to it.
